												<h4>Dynamical effects of stellar feedback on low-mass galaxies</h4>
												<p>Using galaxy simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments <a href="https://fire.northwestern.edu/">(FIRE)</a> project, I have shown that feedback-driven gas outflows can couple energy from stellar feedback to the orbits of stars and dark matter. This causes stars to migrate coherently outward, producing metallicity gradients and apparent outside-in quenching signatures similar to those observed in nearby dwarf galaxies. </p>

											<div class="inner">
											<p>Because stellar feedback disrupts star forming gas clouds, the star formation rate of low-mass galaxies varies in concert with the dynamics and spatial distribution of stars and dark matter. I have shown that this leads to observationally testable predicted correlations between galaxies' star formation rates and their sizes, velocity dispersions, and dark matter density profiles. </p>

											<div class="inner">
											<p> Feedback-driven outflows are dynamically important when (a) star formation is bursty, (b) the potential is shallow, and (c) the baryon fraction is relatively high. I have shown that these conditions are satisfied not only in dwarf galaxies, but also in the high-redshift progenitors of Milky Way-mass galaxies. As a result, many of the dynamical processes discussed above also apply. In particular, I predict the oldest stars in the Milky Way to have migrated outwards since they formed, so that ancient stars are found primarily in the inner stellar halo at $z=0$.</p>

												<h4>Stellar feedback as a driver of gas kinematics and morphology</h4>
												<p>Stars inject energy into their host galaxies' gas through supernovae, radiation pressure, and stellar winds. I have shown that, particularly at low masses, the resulting gas outflows dramatically change galaxies' observable properties, heating their gas and preventing the formation of stable disks. This failure of disk formation turns out to be closely related to the stochastic star formation histories our model predicts for low-mass galaxies. </p>

											<p>More recently, I've studied the occurence rate and separation distribution of very wide binaries, with separations of tens to tens of thousands of AU. <i>Gaia </i> astrometry makes it possible to identify gravitationally bound binaries and eliminate chance alignments with ruthless efficiency, allow us to create a very pure catalog. Using the catalog, we showed that there are fewer-than-expected very wide binaries containing a white dwarf.

											<p>Cross-matching the binary catalog with Galactic spectroscopic surveys allows us to measure how the binary fraction varies with metallicity.

                                    <p>The animation below shows how the normalized optical spectrum of main-sequence stars changes with mass along the main sequence, assuming LAMOST-like resolution ($R\sim 2000$) and wavelength coverage. The spectral model uses <i>The Payne</i>, developed by <a href="http://sns.ias.edu/~ting/">Yuan-Sen Ting</a>, to interpolate between synthetic model spectra.</p>

                                    <p>This animation shows how the LAMOST-like spectrum of an unresolved main-sequence binary system with a solar-type primary changes with mass ratio. The bottom-right panel shows that the spectral signature of binarity is maximized at $q\sim 0.8$.
